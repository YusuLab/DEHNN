PyTorch Geometric (PyG) models are in ```gnn.py``` with the graph convolution implemented in ```graph_conv.py```. We can also use the position encodings from GraphGPS (check ```position_enc/``` for more options).

The baseline of Linear Transformer + LapPE (Laplacian position encoding) is in ```linear_transformer_lappe.py```.
